[1, 2, 3]
> positiveNumbers([-1, -2, -3])
[]
```

## Matrix Addition

Write a function matrixAdd which is given two two-dimensional arrays, and returns a new two-dimensional array containing their matrix sum.

```javascript
> matrixAdd([[[1, 3], [2, 4]], [[5, 2], [1, 0]]])
[ [ 6, 5 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]
```

## Matrix Multiplication

Write a function matrixMultiply which is given two two-dimensional arrays - you can assume the matricies are of size 2x2. It will return the result of matrix multiplication between the two given matricies.

```javascript
> matrixMultiply([[2, 4], [3, 4]], [[5, 2], [3, 1]])
[ [22,  8], [27, 10] ]
```

## Rock Paper Scissors

```javascript
> rockPaperScissors('rock', 'scissors')
'player 1'
> rockPaperScissors('rock', 'paper')
'player 2'
> rockPaperScissors('paper', 'paper')
'draw'
```

## Tic Tac Toe

Write a function ticTacToe which takes a two-dimensional array of size 3x3. Each cell in the two dimensional array can be one of 'O', 'X', or null. The ticTacToe function will determine the winner by

* returning 'O' if O makes a row
* returning 'X' if X makes a row
* return null if neither makes a row

```javascript
> ticTacToe([
  ['O', 'O', 'O'],
  ['X', null, 'X'],
  [null, 'X', null]
  ])
'O'
> ticTacToe([
  ['O', 'X', 'O'],
  ['O', 'X', null],
  [null, 'X', null]
  ])
'X'
> ticTacToe([
  ['O', 'X', 'O'],
  ['O', 'O', null],
  [null, 'X', 'X']
  ])
null
```
